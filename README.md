### What?

First-timers guide is a guide to encourage more people to venture into open-source. The word guide can be a little misunderstood
here; it means articles written in MarkDown format about various topics in Computer Science ranging from time complexity to Word2Vec.
Anyone, literally **anyone** can contribute to the repository

### How?

It's quite simple. Just write an article in MarkDown format about a topic you know; the article should be between 100-150 words and 
easy to read for a newbie. And then pull a request to start. :tada:

### Contributing

1) Fork the project
2) Add your article
3) Follow the rules given [here](https://github.com/the-ethan-hunt/first-timers-guide/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
